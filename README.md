# YummyRecipes [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Tinitto/YummyRecipes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Tinitto/YummyRecipes) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Tinitto/YummyRecipes/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/Tinitto/YummyRecipes)
A web app to save and share food recipes we love.

## About
This project is part of the [Andela Fellowship](https://andela.com/) Self Learning Clinic Curriculum.

The YummyRecipes app is a web application meant to help users save and share recipes of their favourite food.

## Interesting Feature
This web app is built using Flask without a database per se. All data is stored in memory (thus the need for only one worker on the server). 

**Fun fact:** A **'Database'** has been implemented within it using python data structures and types. Find the implementation in /flask_app/app/models.py. And yes! It feels like one, it acts like one, it should thus be one. It is a database! 


## Dependencies
1. Bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha
2. Jquery v3.2.1
3. popper.js v1.11.1+
4. Flask v0.12+
5. Python v3.5+

_Other dependecies can be found in requirements.txt in this repo_
